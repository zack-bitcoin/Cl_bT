The first letter of a word is always a vowel. If it is low, the word starts with an "_", if it is high, then there is no underscore.
The rest of the word is consonant-vowel pairs. Each of these pairs is indicated with a single letter.
If the vowel is high, then the letter takes a high form: F T t l
If the vowel is low, then the letter takes a low form: E C b L

Imagine each letter as a vertical stack of 3 pixels.
The top pixel says whether it is a high or low consonant.
The second pixel says whether it is voiced or unvoiced.
The final pixel encodes the vowel that follows the consonant.

front-c means a consonant that comes from the front of your mouth instead of the back.
voiced-c means that you vibrate your vocal cords while saying this consonant.
low-v means that the vowel following the consonant is low rather than high.

letters:
front-c  voiced-c low-v   sounds like   looks like 
yes      yes      yes     do             E
yes      yes      no      di             F
yes      no       yes     to             C
yes      no       no      ti             T
no       yes      yes     go             b
no       yes      no      gi             t
no       no       yes     ko             L
no       no       no      ki             l

so the alphabet is called "idoditotigogikoki"
which is spelled EFCTbtLl
